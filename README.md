# Achieve!

Achieve!* is an iOS application written entirely in **Swift**.

It’s designed to help you to reach your goals by enabling you to keep track of your progress every step of the way.
<br>
Create projects, add items and earn awards as you complete them.

Achieve! makes use of the **SwiftUI** framework, incorporating **Core Data** and **CloudKit** for data persistence.
<br>
**Accessibility** is at the core of Achieve!, with fully tested support for **VoiceControl**.
<br>
The application fully supports **Dark Mode** and also includes **Internationalization** and **Localization** into Hungarian.

Other features I’ve implemented include: **Haptic Feedback, Spotlight, Notifications, In-App Purchases, Home Screen Quick Actions, Shortcuts and Widgets.**

While developing Achieve!, I learnt much about **Unit Testing**, **UI Testing** and linting my code with **SwiftLint**.
<br>
These tests ensure that the application continues to function correctly now and long into the future.

Achieve! takes a pragmatic approach to the **MVVM** design pattern, incorporating it into the project where it is practical and makes sense.

*Achieve! began as I followed along with Paul Hudson’s Ultimate Portfolio course available on Hacking with Swift+.
<br>
Since then, it has developed into the application it is today, influenced by my own ideas, learnings and style.
